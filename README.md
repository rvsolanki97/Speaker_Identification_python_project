# Speaker_Identification_python_project

Speaker identification is the process of authenticating the speaker's true identity, i.e. the process of automatically recognizing a speaker based on the information contained in each speech wave. This is one of the biometrics applications. This technique allows the speaker's voice to be used to verify his identity. Speaker recognition is done in four steps. The first step is the acquisition of digital data. In the second stage, the function is extracted. The third step involves grouping feature vectors and storing them in the database. The final step is making decisions by matching the pattern. The speaker recognition process involves two different modules, such as Function extraction and function matching. In our project, we used the Mela frequency cepstrum factor (MFCC) method for feature extraction and vector quantization (VQ) for feature matching. The goal of this project is to build a simple and complete speaker recognition system that is tested on a speech database and we use the Tkinter application for demonstration. The complete system is built into the PYTHON Platform.
